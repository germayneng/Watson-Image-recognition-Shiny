# Watson_Image_recognition_Shiny
Utilizing watson's visual API on shiny 

If you have seen  YUKI KATOH's shiny app utilizing tensorflow's API on image classify, then you will know what this is. 
I have this on a live shiny.io, however, since the API is on trial, I have limited usage and will not be posting the url. 


Based on watson's visual recognition API, by uploading any image file, you will get an output of the score confidence of the image from watson. 

# Installation/ usage 
1. You need a blue mix ibm account 
2. Add watson's visual recognition service and get your credentials (API key)
3. Edit the api key in the app.R file. Then you can have fun and get amaze with what watson can go :)
